# Take-Note

## Description

A note taking app deployed on Heroku. It is designed to use express to post and collect notes posted by the user. I struggled a little bit with the heroku deployment, and I forgot to pull from my repository before pushing which caused some commit errors but through some of my  own trouble shooting and some help from TA's I was able to get it all worked out.


## Installation

Heroku is needed to run this application.

## Usage

## Credits
   Credit goes out to all three TA's: Emma, Jessica, and Chris. They were very helpful in answering my questions and just all around supportive.
